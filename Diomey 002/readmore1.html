          <h5>SUPERLIFE TOTAL CARE 30</h5><hr>
          <p>
            Superlife STC30 is the origin of stem cell in treatment and prevention of diseases. The stem cells are undifferentiated 
            biological cells which can be differentiated into specialized cells and can divide (through mitosis) to produce 
            more healthy stem cells. The stem cells are found in both plant and animals. STC30 is plant based stem cell. <br>
            One of the main characteristics of stem cells is their ability to self-renew or multiply while maintaining the potential 
            to develop into other types of cells. Stem cells can become cells of the heart, kidney, liver, bones, skin, brain, muscle etc. <br>
            STC30 has the ability to cure over 274 diseases such as; Diabetes, Stroke, Parkinso, High blood pressure, Cancer, Leukemia, Heart attack, 
            Down syndrome, Spinal cord injury, Baldness, Blindness, Brain trauma, Glaucoma, Kidney diseases, Liver diseases, Prostate 
            enlargement, Deafness, Skin repair and many more.
